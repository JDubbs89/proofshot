# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The domain-modeling skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, note the gap for domain modeling.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
